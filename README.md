    a basic calculator can do * , / , + , -, operations .
    a right triangle calculator, find angles and sides by user enter information.
    a Trig function calculator , calculate sin, cos,tan...... trig function use user enter information

- The project is made up base on 6 main files:
	MainActivity.java
	Trig2Activity.java
	TrigActivity.java
	activity_main.XML
	activity_trig.XML
	activity_trig2.XML

User Stories:
-----------------
	1.As a user, a basic calculator should be able to enter number from 0 to 9, so that i can enter any number.
	2.As a user, a basic calculator should have a “=” to click, and produce answer, so that i can get a answer.
3 .As a user, a basic calculator should have “+”,”-”,”/”,”*”  to click perferman basic math operation,so that it can calculate questions.

Architecture:
----------------
	key java file-
		MainActivity.java
		Trig2Activity.java
		TrigActivity.java
https://github.com/ah110/Assignment5_seg2105/tree/master/app/src/main/java/com/example/a5_seg2105
	key XML file-
		activity_main.XML
		activity_trig.XML
		activity_trig2.XML
https://github.com/ah110/Assignment5_seg2105/tree/master/app/src/main/res/layout
	the project is created in android studio, first setting up activity layout in its XML file, buttons and textview and spinners and edittext, and change different activity layout in this file.
in activity.java file it connects to XML file , assign operation to each button and store value ad doing math calculation, what each button doing is most important in this project, assign them to different function and doing what they should be doing.
	
Testing:
----------
in WiKI
